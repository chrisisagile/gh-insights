Hi Chris,

First off, I want to thank you for your impressive drive and the dedication you’ve shown over the past few months. Your consistent activity and commitment to delivering value—especially in the rhythmicai/rhythmic repo—haven’t gone unnoticed. You’re moving a lot of code and ideas forward, and that energy is the backbone of any high-performing team.

**What You’re Doing Well**

- **Prolific Output & Ownership:** 100 PRs in three months, with 98 in the main repo, is no small feat. The fact that you have no open PRs and a high merge rate shows you’re dependable and take ownership of moving work to completion.
- **Prioritizing Documentation:** 157 lines of documentation updates and an 11% documentation-to-code ratio stand out. Strong docs are often undervalued, but you’re ensuring your changes are accessible to others and the project is maintainable.
- **Willingness to Tackle Complex Areas:** You’re not shying away from security-sensitive changes, which shows confidence and a willingness to take on responsibility where it matters most.

**Opportunities for Growth**

With your productivity, there’s a real opportunity to level up the impact of your work across the team and codebase. Here are a few areas I’d encourage you to focus on:

1. **Boost Automated Test Coverage:** Test coverage is sitting at 3.7%-4.5%, which is low relative to the volume and importance of your changes. Consider making it a habit to include relevant unit and integration tests in every PR, especially for critical logic and security-related code. Even small improvements in each PR will add up quickly.
2. **Right-size PRs for Easier Review:** With an average PR size of 566 changes, reviews can become overwhelming, and important issues may slip through. Try breaking larger changes into smaller, logically grouped PRs. This will make it easier for reviewers to provide meaningful feedback and for you to add targeted tests.
3. **Strengthen Security Practices:** For the 2 PRs involving security-sensitive changes, make sure to add explicit security-focused tests (e.g., invalid input handling, permission checks). Consider using security linters or static analysis tools for an extra layer of protection.
4. **Encourage & Seek Rigorous Reviews:** A 100% merge rate is impressive, but may suggest that critical review steps are being missed. Invite teammates to challenge your assumptions—ask for specific feedback on test coverage or edge case handling when you open PRs.

**30/60/90 Day Skill Development Plan**

**Next 30 Days:**
- Set a baseline: For each new PR, add at least one unit/integration test relevant to your changes.
- Break down at least half of your PRs into <300 change increments.
- Review and adopt a security checklist for sensitive changes.

**Next 60 Days:**
- Aim for a test-to-code ratio of at least 10% on new PRs.
- Pair with a teammate to review each other’s PRs, focusing on testing and security.
- Experiment with automated tools (e.g., code coverage reporters, static analyzers) to catch gaps before review.

**Next 90 Days:**
- Lead a “testing best practices” session for the team, sharing what’s worked for you.
- Target overall repo test coverage improvement. Set a team goal—e.g., 15% coverage—and track progress.
- Mentor a junior developer on writing effective, maintainable tests.

**Resources & Next Steps**

- [Kent C. Dodds' Testing JavaScript](https://testingjavascript.com/) – hands-on, practical approaches to testing.
- [OWASP Secure Coding Practices](https://owasp.org/www-project-secure-coding-practices-quick-reference-guide/) – for security-sensitive PRs.
- Adopt habits like writing tests before submitting code for review, and using PR templates with a testing checklist.
- Try [Codecov](https://about.codecov.io/) or GitHub Actions coverage workflows to visualize your testing impact per PR.

**In Closing**

You’re clearly capable of moving fast and delivering a lot—now is the time to double down on quality and rigor. Building muscle in automated testing and security reviews will not only make your code bulletproof, but will also help you scale your impact by making it easier for others to trust and build on your work. 

You’ve got the momentum—let’s channel it into habits that will make you (and the team) even more resilient and effective. I’m excited to see how you’ll raise the bar in the next quarter!

Let me know how I can help or if you want to pair up on any of these goals.

Keep it up,  
[Your Name]

## Remember

Growth is a journey, not a destination. Every PR, every code review, and every refactoring is an opportunity to improve. The fact that you're seeking feedback shows you're already on the right path.

Keep coding, keep learning, and keep pushing yourself to new heights! 🚀
